# Manhunt Rules

This document outlines the rules that go with the game to be played using the 
[Minecraft Manhunt Plugin](https://github.com/ricetech/MinecraftManhuntPlugin).

Minecraft Manhunt is a game played with at least 2 players split into 2 teams - Hunters and Runners.
In the case of an odd number of players, the extra player is generally given to the Hunters team.

**NOTE:** In these rules, "natural causes" refers to any death not caused by another player. This includes:
- Fall damage
- Environmental damage, including fire, suffocation & lava
- Neutral/Hostile mobs

## Honor Code

While these rules provide as much detail as possible, you should always aim to have fun while playing.
Don't try to circumvent or find a loophole in the rules - that makes it less fun for everyone else.

## Teams and their goals

Both teams start at the world spawn with no items (apart from Compasses).

The Runners get a head start - usually 60 seconds, although that can be changed if the teams are not balanced.

### Runners

- Complete a Minecraft objective (usually an achievement) as fast as possible while avoiding the Hunters. The specific
  objective depends on what version of the game is being played.
- Runners become Eliminated if they die to a Hunter.
- Runners have unlimited lives if they die to other causes, including hostile mobs.

### Eliminated Runners

- Eliminated runners cannot directly contribute to the objective. Here are some examples:
  - If the objective is to kill the Ender Dragon, Eliminated players cannot attack the Ender Dragon.
  - If the objective is to acquire a Blaze Rod, Eliminated players cannot attack Blazes or carry Blaze Rods to a
  surviving Runner.
- Eliminated players can still contribute in other ways provided they don't contribute to the objective itself.
  Here are some examples of permitted actions:
  - Fighting Hunters (as long as they are with surviving Runners)
  - Collecting resources
  - Communicating with Runners
- Eliminated players must play with the surviving Runners. If separated from the Runners 
  (for example, while collecting resources), they cannot attack or otherwise distract Hunters.
  
### Hunters

- Eliminate all of the Runners by killing them before they can complete their objective.
- Hunters have unlimited lives.

## Game Versions

You can play Manhunt with any achievement/advancement set as the goal for the Runners.
Here are some examples to start you off:

- "Short version": Acquire a Blaze Rod by killing a blaze. Blaze rods acquired from other places like chests don't count.
- "Long version": Construct, activate and jump into an End Portal.
- "Full speedrun version": Kill the Ender Dragon.

## Handling Deaths

If a player dies, the circumstances of the death determine what happen next:

__No teleporting is allowed AND Runners are eliminated if a player:__

- Dies to an attack by a member of the opposing team
- Dies to an attack by a tamed mob belonging to a member of the opposing team
- Dies to natural causes while running away from, or in combat with a member of the opposing team
- Intentionally commits suicide in an attempt to escape a member of the opposing team

__No teleporting is allowed but Runners are NOT eliminated if a player:__

- Intentionally commits suicide

__Players are allowed to teleport to a teammate if they__:

- Die to natural causes as described above

__Players are allowed to teleport to a teammate AND have their inventory restored if they__:

- Die as a result of server or client lag

**NOTE:** If a player has no teammates to teleport to, they are allowed to teleport to the location of their death
and are given invincibility for a set period of time (usually 25 seconds).

## Other Rules

- **Beds**: 
  - If you come across another player's bed, you may either destroy the bed or leave it alone.
  However, do NOT spawn camp the bed.
- **Beds in The Nether**:
  - Should not be used.
  - Some plugins such as [EssentialsX Protect](https://essentialsx.net/) can disable this for you.
- **Commands**: 
  - Should not be used aside from commands provided by this plugin and Minecraft's built-in communication/chat commands.
- **Dropped Items**: 
  - May be picked up by or destroyed by any player.
- **Portals**: 
  - Don't trap portals.
  - The plugin grants Fire Resistance to players using portals in case lava is near the portal exit.
- **Restoring Inventories**: 
  - Can be restored by an operator using the `/restoreinventory` command if items were lost to a cause such as lava.
  - All players should agree on the usage of this command before it is used.
  - If another player has picked up items from a restored inventory, they should be discarded since they are now
  duplicates.
- **Spawn Protection**:
  - No player on any team should spawn camp. If two opposing players encounter each other near spawn, they should
  ignore each other and proceed directly back towards their teammates or to collecting resources.
  - Players taking advantage of this rule should not exploit it. Do not distract the other player and make a hasty
  effort to return to your teammates, stopping only if you need resources or food.
